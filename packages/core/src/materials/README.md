# Goals:

- Support shader-network materials.
- Support by default only one material, the glTF PBR next material. It should have simple value inputs, all texture reads are done in the shader-network.

# Challenges:

- How to have a shader easily output normal, depth, diffuse as separate outputs without specialized shaders? Can we have a uniform on a shader that tells it what to output? Could we use the multiple render target output extension? Is it always supported in WebGL2?

# Changes from Three.js

- PhysicalMaterial -> PBRMaterial and heavily refactored.
- Added TextureAccessor.
- All Material.[*]Map will be accessing a TextureAccessor rather than a Texture.
- Material.base -> Material.albedo. This is more accurate.
