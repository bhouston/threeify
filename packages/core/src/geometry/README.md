# General

## Goals

- Simplification.

## Changes from Three.js:

- Removal of non-buffer-based geometry.
- Conversion of do nothing classes into proper factory functions. For example BoxBufferGeometry in Three.js was a class that only had a constructor. It appeared to have properties you could manipulate, but if you did nothing happened. Thus it is best to convert it to a straight forward factory function.
