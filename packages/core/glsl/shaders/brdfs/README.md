# Goals

We will be replicating the Dassault Enterprise PBR model as described here:

https://dassaultsystemes-technology.github.io/EnterprisePBRShadingModel/spec-2021x.md.html#components

# Steps

- Copy reference code into each brdf.
- Then extract patterns from that.

# TODO:

- Study Babylon.js's "pbr.brdf.useEnergyConservation = false;"
- Compare Autodesk's surface shader's energy conservation method with that of Dassault ePBR.
- Study Filament's energy conservation.
