A reusable guassian blur pass.

Should take (1) a source, (2) source lod (-1 is auto), (3) an intermediate buffer, (4) a destination buffer, (5) radius of guassian in terms of destination pixels [determines size of guassian and number of samples].
The intermediate buffer and destination buffer must be the same size.

It will query the center and the surrounding pixels exactly in the center via the textureLod() function.
