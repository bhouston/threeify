# General

## Goals

## Changes from Three.js

- Moved from top level '/cameras' folder into '/nodes/cameras' because Cameras are types of Nodes

# Camera

## Changes from Three.js

- Remove the local matrices variables from the Camera classes. It is hard to cache these effectively.
- This removes the need to automatically update the camera matrices upon changes.
- Added pixelAspectRatio to base Camera class.
- Passing in viewAspectRatio when requesting camera projections, avoids the need for aspectRatio in all cameras.

Q: Why split aspectRatio into pixelAspectRatio and viewAspectRatio?

A: PixelAspectRatio is almost always 1.0, thus leave it alone. ViewAspectRatio comes from the render region, thus you can read it automatically. The end result: No need to manually update aspectRatio any more.

# PerspectiveCamera

## Changes from Three.js

- fov -> verticalFov so no one needs to every ask which dimension it is.
- Removed aspectRatio per above, instead using Camera.pixelAspectRatio and viewAspectRatio from render view.

# Orthographic

## Changes from Three.js

- top, bottom, left, right -> height and center. This is easier to use. Everything else can be derived.

# Learnings from Babylon:

- They have a free camera rather than a perspective or orthographic camera.
- Their camera has a target.
- They can attach their camera to a canvas???? Built in controller?
