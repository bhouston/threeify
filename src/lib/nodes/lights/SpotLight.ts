/**
 * Spot lights emit light in a cone in the direction of the local -z axis. The angle and
 * falloff of the cone is defined using two numbers, the innerConeAngle and outerConeAngle.
 * As with point lights, the brightness also attenuates in a physically correct manner as
 * distance increases from the light's position (i.e. brightness goes like the inverse
 * square of the distance). Spot light intensity refers to the brightness inside the
 * innerConeAngle (and at the location of the light) and is defined in candela, which is
 * lumens per square radian (lm/sr). Engines that don't support two angles for spotlights
 * should use outerConeAngle as the spotlight angle (leaving innerConeAngle to implicitly be 0).
