**threeify** is a Typescript 3D library loosely based on three.js.

Feature overview:

- Modern: Typescript, Tree Shakable, Small Build Files
- Rendering: WebGL 2 and WebGPU (coming soon)
- Materials: Physically based materials
- Post Effects: DOF (coming soon), Motion Blur ((coming soon)), SOA (coming soon), TRAA (coming soon)
- Animation: Clips (coming soon), Mixer (coming soon)
- Assets: glTF (coming soon), Draco (coming soon) and Basis (coming soon)
- XR: Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality via WebXR (coming soon)
- Documented (TSDocs) and Tested (Jest)

### Warning

**_In Development, Not Yet Ready for Use of Any Kind_**

This library is currently in alpha and in midst of significant development. It may not even compile properly. You have been warned.

## Install and Import

Threeify and its modules are published on npm with full typing support. To install, use:

```sh
npm install threeify --save
```

Or

```sh
yarn add threeify
```

This will allow you to import Threeify entirely using:

```javascript
import * as THREEIFY from "threeify"; // NOT YET SUPPORTED
```

or individual classes using:

```javascript
import { RenderContext, Vector3 } from "threeify";
```

### Usage

This code creates a scene, a camera, and a geometric cube, and it adds the cube to the scene. It then creates a `WebGL` renderer context for the scene and camera, and it adds that viewport to the `document.body` element. Finally, it animates the cube within the scene for the camera.

```typescript
import { box } from "@threeify/geometry/primitives/Box";
import { MaterialOutputs } from "@threeify/materials/MaterialOutputs";
import { PhysicalMaterial } from "@threeify/materials/PhysicalMaterial";
import { PerspectiveCamera } from "@threeify/nodes/cameras/PerspectiveCamera";
import { Mesh } from "@threeify/nodes/Mesh";
import { Node } from "@threeify/nodes/Node";
import { RenderingContext } from "@threeify/renderers/webgl2";

const camera = new PerspectiveCamera(70, 0.01, 10);
camera.position.x = 1;

const geometry = box(0.2, 0.2, 0.2);
const material = new PhysicalMaterial();
material.outputs = MaterialOutputs.Normal;

const mesh = new Mesh(geometry, material);

const scene = new Node();
scene.children.add(mesh);

const context = new RenderingContext();
const canvasFramebuffer = context.canvasFramebuffer;
document.body.appendChild(canvasFramebuffer.canvas);

function animate(): void {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);

  mesh.rotation.x += 0.01;
  mesh.rotation.y += 0.02;
  mesh.dirty();

  canvasFramebuffer.render(scene, camera, true);
}

animate();
```

### Development

#### Local

To run:

1. Check out the git repository
1. Install node.js & npm as appropriate for your platform.
1. Run npm install to install all the required node modules from package.json

```
yarn
```

3. To run the automatic typescript builder and dev server go:

```
yarn dev
```

Then open a web server to the address displayed in the console. Usually this will be http://localhost:8000.

#### Docker Compose

If you have docker and docker-compose available do:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Theia-IDE

threeify supports the theia-ide so you can start coding immediately. theia-ide is available at http://localhost:3000. Perform step 3 and 4 in the theia-ide terminal.
